# Project-1-Group 10
## Concept
AS A user
I WANT to type any question from my imagination and see a new response generated though aritificial intelligence.
I WANT to see a fun gif that accompanies the response.
SO THAT I can think of new creative ideas, projects and more.
## Summary
This app was designed to spark the inner creative in all of us. Through the OpenAI API, the user is challenged to stretch the limits of their imagination and to get in touch with their sense of childlike wonder. Simply type in a question and the API will return a response based on your question. To add a touch of fun, the app also generates a gif based on your search through the GIPHY API.
